# CrossFire West VMWare Setup Instructions

This documentation shows in a "step-by-step guide" like way how to setup a Virtual Machine that's able to run CrossFire by using VMWare.  

## Before you begin

Make sure you have downloaded and installed all required programs and files.  

- VMWare Workstation Pro (Tested with Pro 15; other Versions should work, too)
- Windows 7 ISO (Tested with Home Basic/Home Premium; other Versions should work, too)
- CrossFire Client as ZIP (optional; you can also download the client on the VM)

!!! tip
    You don't need a full version of VMWare Workstation Pro for this to work.  
    There's a 30 day trial which is more than enough to get you started.  

## Let's begin

From now on you can simply guide through the whole process by using the arrow navigation on the bottom of this documentation.  
If you're just here for a quick look-up you can use the navigation tree on the left side to navigate to your desired topic.  

Please make sure you've read the `DISCLAIMER` and `LEGAL NOTES` before proceeding.  
This procedure, including the setup & configuration of the virtual machine is nothing illegal or forbidden, but everything you're doing, **you're doing it at your own risk!**
