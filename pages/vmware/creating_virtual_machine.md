# Instructions - Creating a Virtual Machine

Open VMWare Workstation and Select `File -> New Virtual Machine`.

If you don't want to quickly get started select `Typical`.  
However, if you're into PC/VM configuration you can select `Custom` and adjust the settings of your VM to your needs.

Browse your Windows 7 ISO. You will see a hint displaying that VMWare is going to use Easy Install to setup this VM.

Fill out the Easy Install form to fullfill your needs.  
The only thing required by default is a username.  
If you don't enter a license key, Windows is going to run in trial mode.

Configure the size of the partition you want to give your virtual machine.  
50 GB per VM is recommended.  

Once you completed these steps, you will see the complete setup in a summary.  
If you want to adjust your Virtual Machine specs you can do this now.  
Below is a sample configuration of mine.
