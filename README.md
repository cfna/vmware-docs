## Legal Notes

The method used for this to work was not my idea, nor did I find out how to solve this problem by myself.    
I only knew that this is possible, did a bit of research on various sources, from outdated MPGH Threads to YouTube comments about running games on virtual machines.  
I just collected all this information together, figured out a way how it worked for me and started documenting it.
