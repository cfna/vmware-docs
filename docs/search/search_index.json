Downloading VMWare Workstation \u00b6 For this guide you will need VMWare Workstation in order to run CrossFire inside a Virtual Machine. You can download a VMWare trial from their website . Download and install the program. Once you've VMWare Workstation installed, you can proceed with the next step. Downloading Windows 7 ISO \u00b6 Tip When downloading Windows 7 ISO, make sure you're downloading a 64 Bit Version. In this guide the Virtual Machines will be using Windows 7. This will work pretty well with CrossFire even in 2020. If you still own a Windows 7 Key, you can download Windows 7 from Microsoft's Website . If you don't own a Key, you can download a free Windows 7 90 Days Trial from the Internet. You can use a search engine of your choice to find a ISO. Note Tested with Windows 7 Home Premium/Home Basic, but it shouldn't matter which version of Windows you're running. Preparing CrossFire Client \u00b6 Of course the Virtual Machines will need CrossFire in order to run it. You can download and install CrossFire from a Browser directly inside the VM (not recommended if you already have it on you PC). If you've already downloaded CrossFire on your main machine (which is typically the case if you're interested in such kind of topic), you can simply copy your CrossFire folder to the desktop and then ZIP it. The additional copy step is required because the default CrossFire folder is read-only. Keep the zipped CF client on your desktop, you can now proceed with the next section and start setting up a Virtual Machine.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting_started/#getting-started","text":"This Guide contains setup and installation instructions for starters, which are completely new to this topic.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting_started/#downloading-vmware-workstation","text":"For this guide you will need VMWare Workstation in order to run CrossFire inside a Virtual Machine.
