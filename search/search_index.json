Download and install the program. Once you've VMWare Workstation installed, you can proceed with the next step. Downloading Windows 7 ISO \u00b6 In this guide the Virtual Machines will be using Windows 7. This will work pretty well with CrossFire even in 2020. If you still own a Windows 7 Key, you can download Windows 7 from Microsoft's Website . If you don't own a Key, you can download a free Windows 7 90 Days Trial from the Internet. You can use a search engine of your choice to find an ISO. Note You can find a list of tested/supported versions here Preparing CrossFire Client \u00b6 Of course the Virtual Machines will need CrossFire in order to run it. You can download and install CrossFire from a Browser directly inside the VM (not recommended if you already have it on you PC). If you've already downloaded CrossFire on your main machine (which is typically the case if you're interested in such kind of topic), you can simply copy your CrossFire folder to the desktop and then ZIP it. The additional copy step is required because the default CrossFire folder is read-only.
